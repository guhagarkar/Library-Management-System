WE USE MVC ARCHITECTURE FOR LMS:

MVC, which stands for Model-View-Controller, is a software architectural pattern commonly used in designing and developing user interfaces for web applications. It helps in organizing code in a way that separates concerns and promotes modularization, making it easier to manage and maintain large and complex codebases

Model: Represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for data manipulation and storage.

View: Represents the user interface. It displays the data to the user and sends user input to the controller.

Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it, interacts with the Model to update data, and then updates the View.
For our project, By using the concept of MVC architecture, we have Created 3 Different packages named as: a) com.qsp.lms.model
                                  b) com.qsp.lms.view
                                  c) com.qsp.lms.controller
